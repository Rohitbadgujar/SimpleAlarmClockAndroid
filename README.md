Technical and Design Contribution: 

Technical and Design Contribution: Created single seek bar to provide functionality to select a color for hour, minute and second hand. On progress of seekbar the respective color is reflected in the clock. This dynamic functionality makes it very convenient for user to find a perfect color for clock. Application also well designed in terms of styles and it is also user friendly. 

        


Conclusion: The experience of building this application was extremely good and I got exposure to practical knowledge and utilization of resources available in android. I have also learned how to use surfaceView, DatePicker and Time picker.
